## About The Project

A blogging app created using a Django Rest Framework backend and a React frontend. The app supports signups, login, logout, creating/editing posts, as well as liking and commenting on posts.

The API implements REST principles, supports token based authentication, allows filtering through query parameters, and implements a keyword search feature used by the frontend to locate relevant posts.

The React frontend is made up several resuable presentation components as well as container components which provide the apps functionality. It queries the django API using effect hooks as needed to provide page specific information and uses context hooks to route to pages based on authentication status.
